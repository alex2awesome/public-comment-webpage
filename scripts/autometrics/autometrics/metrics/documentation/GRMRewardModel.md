# Metric Card for GRMRewardModel

The GRMRewardModel is a general-purpose reward model designed to evaluate the quality and safety of LLM-generated outputs. It achieves high generalization performance by applying a novel regularization method on hidden states during supervised fine-tuning. GRMRewardModel is fine-tuned on the decontaminated Skywork/Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2 dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results among models of comparable size (3B), even outperforming some 8B reward models and proprietary LLM judges on RewardBench.

## Metric Details

### Metric Description

The GRMRewardModel is a transformer-based reward model that assigns scalar scores to LLM responses based on their alignment with human preferences. Its main innovation lies in *Hidden State Regularization (HSR)*, a method that regularizes the representation space of hidden states across different examples to improve generalization. Unlike most reward models that rely solely on output logits or fine-tune only the final layer, GRM constrains intermediate hidden states using contrastive learning objectives, enabling more robust preference modeling.

This particular instantiation, `Ray2333/GRM-Llama3.2-3B-rewardmodel-ft`, is based on the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model and fine-tuned on the Skywork preference dataset using pairwise comparisons of completions. Given a message (prompt + response), the model outputs a scalar reward score indicating the desirability of the response.

- **Metric Type:** Reference-Free  
- **Range:** Unbounded (typically scaled to [−5, 5] depending on implementation)  
- **Higher is Better?:** Yes  
- **Reference-Based?:** No  
- **Input-Required?:** Yes

### Formal Definition

Let $x$ denote the input prompt and $y$ the response generated by a model. The GRMRewardModel, $f_\theta$, takes the concatenated sequence $(x, y)$ and computes a scalar reward:

$$
\text{Reward} = f_\theta(x, y)
$$

The model is trained on pairwise preferences $(x, y^{+}, y^{-})$ using a pairwise loss function:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{pairwise}} = -\log \sigma(f_\theta(x, y^{+}) - f_\theta(x, y^{-}))
$$

Additionally, during training, a hidden state regularization term is applied across layers:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{HSR}} = \sum _{l=1}^{L} \text{Sim}(h_l^{+}, h_l^{-})
$$

where $h_l^{+}, h_l^{-}$ are the hidden states at layer $l$ for the preferred and dispreferred completions respectively, and $\text{Sim}$ is a similarity or contrastive loss (e.g., cosine similarity or InfoNCE loss).

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**  
  - Tokenized message (prompt + response pair), formatted using the chat template from the underlying Llama tokenizer.  
  - Attention mask.  
  - (During training) Preference pairs.

- **Outputs:**  
  - A scalar reward value representing alignment with human preferences.

## Intended Use

### Domains and Tasks

- **Domain:** Text Generation  
- **Tasks:** Dialogue Generation, Response Generation, Safety Evaluation

### Applicability and Limitations

- **Best Suited For:**  
  Evaluating response quality and safety in conversational agents, especially in RLHF or reranking pipelines where pairwise preferences are available.

- **Not Recommended For:**  
  Evaluating creative generation (e.g., poetry or storytelling) or tasks that require ground-truth references (e.g., translation, summarization).

## Metric Implementation

### Reference Implementations

- **Libraries/Packages:**  
  - [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/Ray2333/GRM-Llama3.2-3B-rewardmodel-ft)  
  - Pretrained model available: `Ray2333/GRM-Llama3.2-3B-rewardmodel-ft`

### Computational Complexity

- **Efficiency:**  
  Inference is comparable to a standard forward pass through a 3B-parameter LLM, efficient for scoring single or batched examples.

- **Scalability:**  
  Scales well to large-scale evaluation or online RLHF pipelines. Small model size (3B) enables practical deployment on modest hardware (e.g., single A100).

## Known Limitations

- **Biases:**  
  Depends on the biases of the preference data (Skywork dataset), which may reflect annotator or cultural preferences.  
  Sensitivity to prompt formatting may affect score stability.

- **Task Misalignment Risks:**  
  Since it is trained on generic preference data, it may not align with task-specific criteria or specialized user needs.

- **Failure Cases:**  
  May output high reward scores for fluent but factually incorrect or manipulative responses, especially outside the training distribution.  
  Does not explicitly verify factual correctness or consistency.
