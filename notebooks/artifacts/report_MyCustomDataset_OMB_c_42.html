Additional consideration would include whether or not the LLM is a reasoning model.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Biases:** \n  - Preference for explicit linguistic markers (e.g., 'please escalate', 'we request') which causes implicit or nuanced asks to be underrated.\n  - Tendency to equate specificity with quality, thereby favoring verbose, checklist-style drafts over concise but clear requests.\n  - Recency or saliency bias toward urgent language (e.g., 'now', 'immediately') that may overweight dramatic but non-critical submissions.\n  - Domain bias where the evaluator better recognizes escalation rationale in high-profile areas (e.g., safety/security) than in technical, regulatory, or bureaucratic topics.\n  - Cultural and linguistic bias against indirect or polite forms of asking common in some languages and cultures, leading to underestimation of clarity.\n  - Conservatism or risk-averse bias prompting under-escalation when uncertainty exists, due to training on safe/responsible responses.\n  - Overreliance on surface features (deadlines, named officials) which can penalize legitimate strategic asks that intentionally omit such details.\n  - Bias toward drafting norms typical of formal institutions, disadvantaging grassroots or informal citizen voices that still merit escalation.\n- **Task Misalignment Risks:** \n  - Treating explicit ask-and-rationale as the sole criterion and ignoring other escalation-relevant factors such as potential harm, legal requirements, or contextual urgency.\n  - Conflating clarity with merit: promoting drafts that ask clearly but for inappropriate or low-priority actions, while suppressing ambiguous drafts that point to serious systemic issues.\n  - Overemphasizing immediate temporal language and thereby escalating issues that are time-stamped but low-impact while de-prioritizing high-impact long-term matters.\n  - Failing to account for confidentiality or safety reasons why a citizen might omit explicit requests or details, and penalizing such cautious wording.\n  - Applying a generic checklist across policy domains without adjusting for domain-specific escalation thresholds or required evidence.\n  - Prioritizing linguistic form over stakeholder alignment, leading to escalation of well-written but misaligned requests and ignoring poorly worded but substantively important concerns.\n  - Using escalation as a binary outcome rather than graded, which can force false all-or-nothing decisions instead of recommending further information-gathering.\n  - Relying on model training priors (e.g., professional memo styles) that mismatch common citizen writing and thus mis-evaluate civic submissions.\n- **Failure Cases:** \n  - False negative: The model fails to escalate a draft that implies a clear ask by context (e.g., reporting imminent public harm) because the citizen used indirect language.\n  - False positive: The model recommends escalation for a draft that contains urgent-sounding language but is a rhetorical complaint without an actionable ask.\n  - Missed domain signal: The model ignores technical indicators (e.g., regulatory citations, incident codes) that make an escalation rationale compelling because it lacks domain-specific knowledge.\n  - Context loss: The model evaluates an excerpt without context and downgrades a draft that in full would include the necessary escalation rationale or authority contact.\n  - Overfitting to format: The model elevates drafts that include template phrases like 'we request' even when the requested action is vague or impractical.\n  - Ambiguity handling failure: The model cannot recommend a graded next step (e.g., request more info) and instead either escalates prematurely or not at all.\n  - Adversarial input: A submitter uses sensationalist wording to game the model into escalation, resulting in resource misallocation.\n  - Privacy/safety oversight: The model suggests escalation that would expose sensitive personal data or jeopardize whistleblower safety because it doesn't flag confidentiality concerns.\n  - Hallucination: The model invents a rationale or urgency (e.g., claiming a deadline exists) when none is present and bases an escalation recommendation on that hallucination.\n  - Cultural misread: The model undervalues directness-missing but culturally normative phrasing and therefore fails to escalate legitimate requests from certain populations.\n\n## Related Metrics\n\n- **Related Metrics:**\n  -

Additional consideration would include whether or not the LLM is a reasoning model.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Biases:** \n  - Surface-form bias: preferring drafts that explicitly list contact details and timelines regardless of their appropriateness or accuracy.\n  - Authority bias: favoring drafts that invoke official-sounding steps or titles even if those steps are infeasible or irrelevant to the agency.\n  - Privacy-neglect bias: underweighting concerns about exposing sensitive contact details or asking for contact where doing so would risk the submitter.\n  - English/format bias: treating English-language or Western-styled contact conventions (email/phone) as normative and penalizing other cultural or local conventions.\n  - Technical-access bias: assuming recipients have access to email/phone or can attend meetings, disadvantaging drafts that suggest low-bandwidth or asynchronous paths.\n  - Recency/verbosity bias: equating more detailed timelines and multiple contact options with higher quality, even when succinct or limited contact is preferable.\n  - Policy-ignorance bias: giving equal credit to contact paths that violate agency rules because the judge lacks domain-specific constraints.\n  - Template bias: over-recognizing templated phrasings (e.g., \u201cplease contact us at\u201d) as sufficient evidence of contactability without verifying completeness.\n- **Task Misalignment Risks:** \n  - Focusing solely on contactability may ignore whether escalation is appropriate, ethical, or permitted under agency rules (e.g., privacy, confidentiality, or legal restrictions).\n  - The axis conflates presence of contact/timelines with effective escalation, missing crucial dimensions like content accuracy, urgency, or jurisdictional relevance.\n  - Automated prioritization based on this axis could systematically escalate low-quality but well-formatted drafts while leaving out urgent reports that lack explicit contact fields.\n  - Evaluating drafts by this axis might incentivize authors to include contact info even when doing so endangers the submitter (e.g., sensitive complaints, whistleblowing).\n  - The axis may promote a single-mode view of contact (meeting requests, phone, email) and fail to recognize acceptable alternative contacts (advocates, ombudspersons, anonymous reporting portals).\n  - If the judge lacks access to agency-specific escalation workflows, it may recommend contact paths that conflict with mandated procedures, causing operational friction.\n  - Narrow axis emphasis can produce blind spots for accessibility needs (e.g., accommodations, language access) that affect actual contactability.\n- **Failure Cases:** \n  - False positive escalation: the judge flags a draft as actionable because it lists contact info, but the contact is inappropriate (private email, non-agency account) or fabricated.\n  - False negative escalation: a high-priority submission lacking explicit contact fields is downgraded despite clear urgency and a need for agency follow-up.\n  - Privacy breach risk: the judge recommends adding contact prompts or public meeting requests for submissions that should remain confidential, exposing the submitter to harm.\n  - Policy-conflict recommendation: the judge elevates a draft that requests direct meetings contrary to agency protocols (e.g., legal review required before contact).\n  - Misinterpreted timelines: ambiguous phrasing like 'as soon as possible' or 'within two weeks' is mis-scored or normalized incorrectly, leading to incorrect urgency assessments.\n  - Unverifiable contact acceptance: the judge accepts embedded phone/email without verifying format, leading to escalation attempts that bounce or reach the wrong person.\n  - Cultural/format misread: nonstandard contact methods (social-service caseworker, community liaison) are penalized, reducing appropriate follow-up for certain populations.\n  - Template gaming: actors craft superficially complete contact/timeline fields to get escalated even when the underlying request is irrelevant or malicious.\n  - Accessibility neglect: the judge recommends in-person meetings without noting accommodation needs or alternatives, creating barriers for some submitters.\n  - Ambiguity in scope: the judge escalates drafts whose requested follow-up falls outside the agency's jurisdiction, wasting resources and causing delays.\n\n## Related Metrics\n\n- **Related Metrics:**\n  -

Additional consideration would include whether or not the LLM is a reasoning model.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Biases:** \n  - Recency bias: preferring guidance it 'remembers' and penalizing newer or updated guidance beyond the model's knowledge cutoff.\n  - Authority/source bias: favoring OMB memos over other legitimate grounding sources (statutes, regs, agency-specific dockets).\n  - Exact-match bias: rewarding verbatim citation formatting while penalizing paraphrased or partial but correct references.\n  - Jurisdictional bias: assuming OMB guidance applies uniformly across contexts instead of checking topical/applicability differences.\n  - Language bias: worse performance on citations in languages or formats not well represented in training data.\n  - Confirmation bias: more likely to accept citations that fit expected patterns and to distrust atypical but correct references.\n  - Format bias: privileging citations in a specific citation style (dates/section numbers) over other valid identifiers (docket names, RINs).\n  - Availability bias: over-relying on well-known/high-profile memos and under-weighting obscure but relevant guidance.\n- **Task Misalignment Risks:** \n  - Overfocusing on citation form rather than substantive policy relevance, causing escalations for formally-cited but irrelevant drafts.\n  - Penalizing valid drafts that ground requests in non-OMB authorities (statutes, CFR sections, agency dockets) because the axis privileges OMB citations.\n  - Treating absence of exact date/section numbers as fatal even when the referenced guidance is clearly identifiable by title or subject.\n  - Failing to account for superseded, amended, or revoked guidance and thus mis-evaluating whether a citation is current and applicable.\n  - Prioritizing easily-verifiable docket identifiers while ignoring context that affects applicability (e.g., rulemaking stage).\n  - Applying the same strictness across all submissions regardless of intended escalation level (informational vs high-priority), leading to mismatched triage.\n  - Relying on model-internal knowledge rather than external verification, causing confident but unsupported judgments about citation existence.\n  - Encouraging writers to insert boilerplate citations to pass the axis instead of producing accurate, substantive grounding.\n- **Failure Cases:** \n  - Hallucinated citations: the judge accepts or invents OMB memo titles/dates/sections that do not exist.\n  - False negatives: rejecting correct but paraphrased or abbreviated citations because they do not match expected strings exactly.\n  - Outdated-evidence error: marking a citation as valid when it has been superseded or revoked (or marking a current citation as invalid due to model cutoff).\n  - Incorrect attribution: assigning a memo to OMB when it originated from another agency or interagency source.\n  - Docket misidentification: accepting an incorrect docket identifier that is plausibly formatted but points to a different proceeding.\n  - Context-mismatch: flagging a technically accurate citation that is not actually relevant to the citizen's request or jurisdiction.\n  - Overconfidence: producing definitive verification statements without external lookup, leading to misleading escalation decisions.\n  - Partial-match acceptance: treating a partial or similarly numbered section as fully correct when it materially changes meaning.\n  - Failure to detect confidentiality or restricted dockets and recommending escalation where inappropriate.\n  - Bias-amplified errors: systematically downgrading submissions from certain demographic or stylistic groups due to language/form differences in citations.\n  - Format-only scoring: rewarding drafts that include citations formatted correctly but that misuse or misunderstand the cited guidance content.\n  - Chain-of-trust error: assuming a cited memo's guidance applies wholesale without checking whether later guidance or agency interpretations modify its applicability.\n\n## Related Metrics\n\n- **Related Metrics:**\n  -

- **Tasks:** 
  - Escalation triage for citizen submissions
  - Ranking candidate feedback drafts by clarity of ask
  - Identifying missing escalation rationale or timing justifications
  - Summarizing the specific requests and why escalation is needed
  - Flagging drafts that require urgent human review
  - Generating concise commentary to help editors improve clarity
- **Best Suited For:** 
  - Inputs are written in clear, grammatical language where asks and rationales are present or clearly absent.
  - A small-to-moderate set of candidate drafts must be ranked quickly using a consistent rubric.
  - Escalation criteria are well defined and do not rely on institutional knowledge or confidential context.
  - High-volume, low-to-medium-stakes workflows where automated triage speeds human review.
  - When the goal is to detect and report missing explicit asks or weak timing justifications rather than to make final policy decisions.
- **Not Recommended For:** 
  - Situations requiring verification of factual claims, legal interpretation, or confidential case details that the model cannot access or validate.
  - High-stakes escalation decisions involving political sensitivity, safety, legal liability, or ethics where human judgment and institutional accountability are required.
  - Inputs that are ambiguous, heavily implied, culturally or politically nuanced, or adversarial, where subtle reading and context are essential.
  - Workflows requiring fully auditable, provenance-backed decisions for regulatory compliance without human review.
  - Very long threads or multi-document contexts where essential context is distributed and must be reconciled before judging escalation rationale.</pre></div></li>

- **Tasks:** 
  - Policy feedback triage and escalation
  - Draft response ranking for agency follow-up readiness
  - Customer/citizen correspondence screening for contactability
  - Quality control of template responses for next-step clarity
  - Prioritization of messages that require routing to officials
- **Best Suited For:** 
  - Drafts are short to medium length and contain explicit procedural language (e.g., 'please meet', 'we will follow up by', 'contact at')
  - The evaluation goal is binary or scalar (present/absent or degree of concreteness) rather than fact verification
  - Responses follow institutional templates or consistent phrasing that the judge can learn to recognize
  - There is no need to validate contact information against external databases — only to check presence and format
  - High volume of submissions where rapid, consistent triage is required
- **Not Recommended For:** 
  - Situations that require external validation of contact details, calendar availability, or the truthfulness of claims
  - Cases needing nuanced legal, medical, or highly specialized policy interpretation to decide escalation
  - Inputs that are long, ambiguous, or heavily implicit about next steps or contactability
  - Workflows that involve sensitive personal data requiring strict privacy or compliance checks beyond surface text features
  - Multilingual materials or noisy OCR text where format detection and language understanding degrade</pre></div></li>

- **Tasks:** 
  - Rank candidate policy feedback drafts by citation completeness and specificity
  - Flag drafts that cite OMB memos with missing or malformed dates/section identifiers
  - Detect discrepancies between asserted policy claims and the citations provided
  - Triage which citizen submissions merit escalation to agency officials based on citation strength
  - Classify drafts as adequately grounded, insufficiently grounded, or unverifiable (given provided text)
  - Generate structured summaries of cited guidance (when source excerpts provided) for reviewers
  - Identify ambiguous or vague references (e.g., 'recent OMB guidance') that need precise docket/memo identifiers
- **Best Suited For:** 
  - High-volume triage where drafts include explicit citation strings (title, memo date, docket ID) that can be pattern-matched.
  - Workflows that supply the model with the full text or authoritative excerpts of the referenced OMB memos for cross-checking.
  - Situations where the goal is to flag potential issues (missing/malformed citations, unsupported claims) to prioritize human review.
  - Automated pre-screening to reduce reviewer load by filtering clearly well-grounded vs. clearly deficient drafts.
  - Quality-control checks for internal consistency (e.g., whether the date in the citation matches the memo title provided).
  - Integration into a human-in-the-loop pipeline where final escalations and legal interpretations are made by agency officials.
- **Not Recommended For:** 
  - Cases demanding authoritative, up-to-date verification against live federal dockets or OMB repositories when those documents are not provided in the prompt.
  - Situations that require legal interpretation of how a cited OMB memo applies to complex policy facts or regulatory obligations.
  - High-stakes final decisions (e.g., formal agency responses or legal filings) without human expert review and source verification.
  - Inputs with ambiguous, abbreviated, or OCR-corrupted citations that require external research to resolve.
  - Tasks that expect the model to invent or recall precise section contents or docket histories beyond its training cutoff or provided sources.
  - Contexts that require tracking real-time changes to guidance (rescissions, superseding memos) where model cannot access live updates.</pre></div></li></ul></div></div>

  - Preference for explicit linguistic markers (e.g., 'please escalate', 'we request') which causes implicit or nuanced asks to be underrated.
  - Tendency to equate specificity with quality, thereby favoring verbose, checklist-style drafts over concise but clear requests.
  - Recency or saliency bias toward urgent language (e.g., 'now', 'immediately') that may overweight dramatic but non-critical submissions.
  - Domain bias where the evaluator better recognizes escalation rationale in high-profile areas (e.g., safety/security) than in technical, regulatory, or bureaucratic topics.
  - Cultural and linguistic bias against indirect or polite forms of asking common in some languages and cultures, leading to underestimation of clarity.
  - Conservatism or risk-averse bias prompting under-escalation when uncertainty exists, due to training on safe/responsible responses.
  - Overreliance on surface features (deadlines, named officials) which can penalize legitimate strategic asks that intentionally omit such details.
  - Bias toward drafting norms typical of formal institutions, disadvantaging grassroots or informal citizen voices that still merit escalation.
- **Task Misalignment Risks:** 
  - Treating explicit ask-and-rationale as the sole criterion and ignoring other escalation-relevant factors such as potential harm, legal requirements, or contextual urgency.
  - Conflating clarity with merit: promoting drafts that ask clearly but for inappropriate or low-priority actions, while suppressing ambiguous drafts that point to serious systemic issues.
  - Overemphasizing immediate temporal language and thereby escalating issues that are time-stamped but low-impact while de-prioritizing high-impact long-term matters.
  - Failing to account for confidentiality or safety reasons why a citizen might omit explicit requests or details, and penalizing such cautious wording.
  - Applying a generic checklist across policy domains without adjusting for domain-specific escalation thresholds or required evidence.
  - Prioritizing linguistic form over stakeholder alignment, leading to escalation of well-written but misaligned requests and ignoring poorly worded but substantively important concerns.
  - Using escalation as a binary outcome rather than graded, which can force false all-or-nothing decisions instead of recommending further information-gathering.
  - Relying on model training priors (e.g., professional memo styles) that mismatch common citizen writing and thus mis-evaluate civic submissions.
- **Failure Cases:** 
  - False negative: The model fails to escalate a draft that implies a clear ask by context (e.g., reporting imminent public harm) because the citizen used indirect language.
  - False positive: The model recommends escalation for a draft that contains urgent-sounding language but is a rhetorical complaint without an actionable ask.
  - Missed domain signal: The model ignores technical indicators (e.g., regulatory citations, incident codes) that make an escalation rationale compelling because it lacks domain-specific knowledge.
  - Context loss: The model evaluates an excerpt without context and downgrades a draft that in full would include the necessary escalation rationale or authority contact.
  - Overfitting to format: The model elevates drafts that include template phrases like 'we request' even when the requested action is vague or impractical.
  - Ambiguity handling failure: The model cannot recommend a graded next step (e.g., request more info) and instead either escalates prematurely or not at all.
  - Adversarial input: A submitter uses sensationalist wording to game the model into escalation, resulting in resource misallocation.
  - Privacy/safety oversight: The model suggests escalation that would expose sensitive personal data or jeopardize whistleblower safety because it doesn't flag confidentiality concerns.
  - Hallucination: The model invents a rationale or urgency (e.g., claiming a deadline exists) when none is present and bases an escalation recommendation on that hallucination.
  - Cultural misread: The model undervalues directness-missing but culturally normative phrasing and therefore fails to escalate legitimate requests from certain populations.</pre></div></li>
<li><strong>Follow_Up_Path_and_Contactability_gpt-5-mini:</strong><div class="mt-2"><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; background:#f8f9fa; padding:8px; border-radius:6px;">- **Biases:** 
  - Surface-form bias: preferring drafts that explicitly list contact details and timelines regardless of their appropriateness or accuracy.
  - Authority bias: favoring drafts that invoke official-sounding steps or titles even if those steps are infeasible or irrelevant to the agency.
  - Privacy-neglect bias: underweighting concerns about exposing sensitive contact details or asking for contact where doing so would risk the submitter.
  - English/format bias: treating English-language or Western-styled contact conventions (email/phone) as normative and penalizing other cultural or local conventions.
  - Technical-access bias: assuming recipients have access to email/phone or can attend meetings, disadvantaging drafts that suggest low-bandwidth or asynchronous paths.
  - Recency/verbosity bias: equating more detailed timelines and multiple contact options with higher quality, even when succinct or limited contact is preferable.
  - Policy-ignorance bias: giving equal credit to contact paths that violate agency rules because the judge lacks domain-specific constraints.
  - Template bias: over-recognizing templated phrasings (e.g., “please contact us at”) as sufficient evidence of contactability without verifying completeness.
- **Task Misalignment Risks:** 
  - Focusing solely on contactability may ignore whether escalation is appropriate, ethical, or permitted under agency rules (e.g., privacy, confidentiality, or legal restrictions).
  - The axis conflates presence of contact/timelines with effective escalation, missing crucial dimensions like content accuracy, urgency, or jurisdictional relevance.
  - Automated prioritization based on this axis could systematically escalate low-quality but well-formatted drafts while leaving out urgent reports that lack explicit contact fields.
  - Evaluating drafts by this axis might incentivize authors to include contact info even when doing so endangers the submitter (e.g., sensitive complaints, whistleblowing).
  - The axis may promote a single-mode view of contact (meeting requests, phone, email) and fail to recognize acceptable alternative contacts (advocates, ombudspersons, anonymous reporting portals).
  - If the judge lacks access to agency-specific escalation workflows, it may recommend contact paths that conflict with mandated procedures, causing operational friction.
  - Narrow axis emphasis can produce blind spots for accessibility needs (e.g., accommodations, language access) that affect actual contactability.
- **Failure Cases:** 
  - False positive escalation: the judge flags a draft as actionable because it lists contact info, but the contact is inappropriate (private email, non-agency account) or fabricated.
  - False negative escalation: a high-priority submission lacking explicit contact fields is downgraded despite clear urgency and a need for agency follow-up.
  - Privacy breach risk: the judge recommends adding contact prompts or public meeting requests for submissions that should remain confidential, exposing the submitter to harm.
  - Policy-conflict recommendation: the judge elevates a draft that requests direct meetings contrary to agency protocols (e.g., legal review required before contact).
  - Misinterpreted timelines: ambiguous phrasing like 'as soon as possible' or 'within two weeks' is mis-scored or normalized incorrectly, leading to incorrect urgency assessments.
  - Unverifiable contact acceptance: the judge accepts embedded phone/email without verifying format, leading to escalation attempts that bounce or reach the wrong person.
  - Cultural/format misread: nonstandard contact methods (social-service caseworker, community liaison) are penalized, reducing appropriate follow-up for certain populations.
  - Template gaming: actors craft superficially complete contact/timeline fields to get escalated even when the underlying request is irrelevant or malicious.
  - Accessibility neglect: the judge recommends in-person meetings without noting accommodation needs or alternatives, creating barriers for some submitters.
  - Ambiguity in scope: the judge escalates drafts whose requested follow-up falls outside the agency's jurisdiction, wasting resources and causing delays.</pre></div></li>
<li><strong>Policy_Citation_and_Evidence_Grounding_gpt-5-mini:</strong><div class="mt-2"><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; background:#f8f9fa; padding:8px; border-radius:6px;">- **Biases:** 
  - Recency bias: preferring guidance it 'remembers' and penalizing newer or updated guidance beyond the model's knowledge cutoff.
  - Authority/source bias: favoring OMB memos over other legitimate grounding sources (statutes, regs, agency-specific dockets).
  - Exact-match bias: rewarding verbatim citation formatting while penalizing paraphrased or partial but correct references.
  - Jurisdictional bias: assuming OMB guidance applies uniformly across contexts instead of checking topical/applicability differences.
  - Language bias: worse performance on citations in languages or formats not well represented in training data.
  - Confirmation bias: more likely to accept citations that fit expected patterns and to distrust atypical but correct references.
  - Format bias: privileging citations in a specific citation style (dates/section numbers) over other valid identifiers (docket names, RINs).
  - Availability bias: over-relying on well-known/high-profile memos and under-weighting obscure but relevant guidance.
- **Task Misalignment Risks:** 
  - Overfocusing on citation form rather than substantive policy relevance, causing escalations for formally-cited but irrelevant drafts.
  - Penalizing valid drafts that ground requests in non-OMB authorities (statutes, CFR sections, agency dockets) because the axis privileges OMB citations.
  - Treating absence of exact date/section numbers as fatal even when the referenced guidance is clearly identifiable by title or subject.
  - Failing to account for superseded, amended, or revoked guidance and thus mis-evaluating whether a citation is current and applicable.
  - Prioritizing easily-verifiable docket identifiers while ignoring context that affects applicability (e.g., rulemaking stage).
  - Applying the same strictness across all submissions regardless of intended escalation level (informational vs high-priority), leading to mismatched triage.
  - Relying on model-internal knowledge rather than external verification, causing confident but unsupported judgments about citation existence.
  - Encouraging writers to insert boilerplate citations to pass the axis instead of producing accurate, substantive grounding.
- **Failure Cases:** 
  - Hallucinated citations: the judge accepts or invents OMB memo titles/dates/sections that do not exist.
  - False negatives: rejecting correct but paraphrased or abbreviated citations because they do not match expected strings exactly.
  - Outdated-evidence error: marking a citation as valid when it has been superseded or revoked (or marking a current citation as invalid due to model cutoff).
  - Incorrect attribution: assigning a memo to OMB when it originated from another agency or interagency source.
  - Docket misidentification: accepting an incorrect docket identifier that is plausibly formatted but points to a different proceeding.
  - Context-mismatch: flagging a technically accurate citation that is not actually relevant to the citizen's request or jurisdiction.
  - Overconfidence: producing definitive verification statements without external lookup, leading to misleading escalation decisions.
  - Partial-match acceptance: treating a partial or similarly numbered section as fully correct when it materially changes meaning.
  - Failure to detect confidentiality or restricted dockets and recommending escalation where inappropriate.
  - Bias-amplified errors: systematically downgrading submissions from certain demographic or stylistic groups due to language/form differences in citations.
  - Format-only scoring: rewarding drafts that include citations formatted correctly but that misuse or misunderstand the cited guidance content.
  - Chain-of-trust error: assuming a cited memo's guidance applies wholesale without checking whether later guidance or agency interpretations modify its applicability.</pre></div></li></ul></div></div>

      <h3>Metric Summary</h3>
      <p>This aggregate metric estimates how escalation-worthy a submission is by linearly combining three component judgments: it most strongly rewards a clear, explicit ask with a stated rationale, next prioritizes the presence of concrete follow-up paths and contactability, and only lightly credits precise policy citations. The design suits high-volume triage: it helps rank drafts that are specific about what they want, why now, and how officials can respond. Its strengths are transparency and operational alignment, making it easy to explain why a draft scored highly and to coach authors to improve clarity and next-step readiness. However, it can under-score substantively important but implicitly framed submissions, over-reward well-formatted but low-priority requests, and reflect cultural or stylistic biases toward formal institutional language. The weak weight on citation means evidentiary grounding can be under-emphasized, so the score should not substitute for content relevance, risk, or jurisdiction checks. Because sample items show mid-range predicted scores despite true c=0, model calibration and decision thresholds must be tuned to the agency’s tolerance for false positives vs. false negatives. Regular retraining, cross-domain validation, and reliability checks (e.g., calibration curves) are advised, and human-in-the-loop review remains necessary for rights- or safety-impacting cases.</p>
