Additional consideration would include whether or not the LLM is a reasoning model.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Biases:** \n  - Authority bias: favoring government/academic sources and downgrading community, industry, or non\u2011traditional evidence regardless of relevance.\n  - Recency bias: giving more weight to newer sources even when older foundational studies or legal citations are more relevant.\n  - Format bias: preferring fully formatted citations and URLs over informal but accurate references or attachments.\n  - Language and geographic bias: privileging English\u2011language or U.S. federal sources and undervaluing non\u2011English or local/regional evidence.\n  - Quantitative bias: favoring submissions that present numbers even when qualitative evidence is more informative for the issue.\n  - Traceability bias: equating the presence of a URL or docket ID with credibility without verifying content.\n  - Publication bias: overvaluing peer\u2011reviewed literature and undervaluing credible gray literature (technical reports, agency memos).\n  - Confirmation bias: tending to credit evidence that aligns with common assumptions about policy impacts more readily than surprising counterevidence.\n  - Availability bias: relying on sources the model has been trained on or can recall easily, disadvantaging obscure but valid sources.\n  - Conservatism bias: penalizing novel analyses or original calculations because they lack an established publication trail.\n- **Task Misalignment Risks:** \n  - Scoring may prioritize traceable citation form over decision relevance, favoring citations that are easily verifiable rather than those most directly informing agency action.\n  - The rubric can encourage citation padding\u2014adding many superficial or low\u2011quality references to get a higher score\u2014rather than substantive evidence integration.\n  - It may penalize concise but high\u2011quality submissions that summarize evidence without reproducing full citations or links.\n  - The judge might undervalue first\u2011hand community testimony or qualitative harms that are highly relevant for policy but lack traditional citations.\n  - Because the model cannot access paywalled or proprietary attachments, it may downgrade otherwise strong, decision\u2011relevant evidence that isn't public.\n  - The rubric assumes public, reproducible citations; submissions based on internal agency data or confidential sources could be misjudged.\n  - Local or context\u2011specific evidence (e.g., tribal, municipal data) may be unfairly scored lower for not matching national\u2011level citation norms.\n  - The axis focuses on evidentiary depth and may miss timeliness or urgency signals that warrant escalation despite limited citations.\n- **Failure Cases:** \n  - Hallucinated verification: the model asserts that quoted citations are valid or finds supporting text when it cannot actually access the source.\n  - False negatives for shorthand citations: downgrading submissions that use accepted shorthand (e.g., 'EPA Toxics 2020') even though a human reviewer would recognize them.\n  - False positives for fabricated citations: awarding higher scores to convincing but nonexistent reports or doctored docket IDs because format looks plausible.\n  - Inability to follow links or attachments: incorrectly scoring a submission as low\u2011evidence because links are to paywalled PDFs or attachments the model cannot retrieve.\n  - Overrating quantity over quality: giving high scores to submissions listing many low\u2011credibility links (blogs, press releases) instead of a few strong sources.\n  - Misinterpreting statistical claims: failing to spot misuse of statistics (e.g., incorrect denominators, conflating percentage points with percent change) and overrating evidence quality.\n  - Failure to detect cherry\u2011picking: not recognizing when numbers are selectively presented without acknowledging counterevidence or uncertainty.\n  - Inconsistency across similar inputs: scoring similar submissions differently due to subtle wording changes that trigger different internal heuristics.\n  - Context blindness: treating a legal citation as authoritative even when jurisdiction or statutory context makes it irrelevant to the agency's authority.\n  - Adversarial formatting: being manipulated by maliciously formatted text (fake URLs, embedded citations in images) to inflate a submission's score.\n  - Over\u2011penalizing qualitative evidence: incorrectly assigning the lowest scores to persuasive firsthand accounts because they lack traditional citations.\n  - Undervaluing original analysis: penalizing submissions that include novel calculations because the judge cannot reproduce methods or validate datasets.\n\n## Related Metrics\n\n- **Related Metrics:**\n  - **LevenshteinDistance:** Levenshtein Distance measures the minimum number of single-character edits\u2014insertions, deletions, or substitutions\u2014required to transform one sequence into another.\n  - **BARTScore:** BARTScore is a reference-based evaluation metric for text generation that formulates evaluation as a text generation task.\n  - **PseudoPARENT:** **PseudoPARENT** is a *custom adaptation* of the PARENT metric for evaluating text generation from structured inputs.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- **Papers:**\n  - [Autometrics](https://github.com/XenonMolecule/autometrics)\n  - [Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uccHPGDlao)\n\n## Citation\n\n```\n@software{Ryan_Autometrics_2025,\n    author = {Ryan, Michael J. and Zhang, Yanzhe and Salunkhe, Amol and Chu, Yi and Rahman, Emily and Xu, Di and Yang, Diyi},\n    license = {MIT},\n    title = {{Autometrics}},\n    url = {https://github.com/XenonMolecule/autometrics},\n    version = {1.0.0},\n    year = {2025}\n}\n```\n\n## Metric Card Authors\n\n- **Authors:** This metric card was automatically generated by gpt-5.\n- **Acknowledgement of AI Assistance:** This metric card was entirely automatically generated by gpt-5 using the Autometrics library.

Additional consideration would include whether or not the LLM is a reasoning model.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Biases:** \n  - Formality bias: preferring professional, well-formatted language and downranking grassroots or informal but actionable submissions.\n  - Surface-cue bias: overweighting explicit metadata (docket numbers, headers) over implicit or paraphrased procedural references.\n  - Native-language bias: misjudging clarity or civility for non-native or dialectal phrasing as less readable or less civil.\n  - Civility detection errors: failing to detect sarcasm, coded hostility, or polite but hostile framing and thus mis-scoring tone.\n  - Attachment accessibility bias: penalizing attachments that are accessible to humans but not machine-readable (e.g., scanned PDFs without OCR).\n  - Conservatism/leniency calibration bias: systematic tendency to score more harshly or leniently depending on training examples or default thresholds.\n  - Template familiarity bias: rewarding submissions that follow common templates and penalizing novel but valid organizational formats.\n  - Confirmation/anchoring bias: initial cues (e.g., a clear docket ID) anchoring the score and causing the model to overlook other deficiencies.\n- **Task Misalignment Risks:** \n  - Over-prioritizing formatting over substance, causing highly substantive but informally presented comments to be under-escalated.\n  - Penalizing legitimate privacy-conscious submissions that intentionally omit full contact details, thereby missing actionable policy signals.\n  - Treating presence of a docket ID as sufficient for escalation even when the substantive content references the wrong proceeding or misunderstanding.\n  - Equating machine-readable attachments with real-world accessibility and ignoring context where a human reviewer could readily access materials.\n  - Reducing complex procedural nuance (e.g., comments intended for different agency office or multiple dockets) to a single score, losing important distinctions for escalation.\n  - Favoring submissions that match bureaucratic expectations and marginalizing nontraditional stakeholders (community groups, oral testimony transcripts).\n  - Applying rigid civility standards that could suppress escalation of urgent but emotionally charged citizen feedback.\n  - Failing to account for redacted or anonymized submissions that are nevertheless delegable to officials for policy significance.\n- **Failure Cases:** \n  - False negative: a clearly actionable submission is scored low because it uses informal structure and lacks a formal header.\n  - False positive: a well-formatted template letter with incorrect docket ID is scored highly and escalated despite pointing to the wrong rule.\n  - OCR/attachment failure: attachments are present as scanned images and are treatable as inaccessible, causing downgrading despite being readable to human reviewers.\n  - Link resolution failure: the model marks hyperlinks as broken because it cannot follow or validate them, even though they work in a browser.\n  - Civility misclassification: polite but critical language is flagged as hostile due to sarcasm or idiomatic expressions, lowering the civility score.\n  - Contact detection error: the model misses contact information that is present but embedded in a signature image or unconventional location.\n  - Docket parsing error: transposed digits or slight formatting differences cause the model to treat a correct docket reference as absent/incorrect.\n  - Inconsistent scoring: nearly identical submissions receive different scores across runs due to nondeterministic model outputs or subtle prompt sensitivity.\n  - Over-reliance on explicit headings: submissions with clear logical flow but without explicit headings are underrated relative to wordier submissions with headings.\n  - Accessibility overreach: the model downgrades submissions for not including alt text or accessibility metadata even when the agency does not require it, causing unnecessary non-escalation.\n  - Privacy-preserving submission missed: anonymous or redacted submissions with high policy relevance are rejected because contact details are missing.\n  - Hallucinated content: the model asserts the presence of attachments or contact details that do not exist, creating incorrect recommendations for escalation.\n\n## Related Metrics\n\n- **Related Metrics:**\n  -

Additional consideration would include whether or not the LLM is a reasoning model.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Biases:** \n  - Surface-form bias: overvaluing explicit citations, docket numbers, or legalistic phrasing even when underlying requests are impractical.\n  - Recency and training-data bias: relying on patterns in training corpora that may not reflect current statutes, agency structures, or recent rulemaking practices.\n  - Formality bias: favoring submissions that use technical or formal language and penalizing plain-language citizen input regardless of substance.\n  - Jurisdictional bias: assuming common agency responsibilities or structures and misattributing which office/unit can act.\n  - Conservatism bias: penalizing novel or unconventional but feasible implementation ideas because they deviate from familiar templates.\n  - Confirmation bias from keywords: interpreting presence of certain words (e.g., 'CFR', 'docket', 'redline') as proxies for high actionability.\n  - Language and cultural bias: lower scoring for submissions that use different rhetorical styles, idioms, or non-native-English phrasing.\n  - Overconfidence bias: producing confident judgments about legal or operational feasibility despite lacking authoritative verification.\n- **Task Misalignment Risks:** \n  - Keyword overfitting: optimizing for presence of axis-specific words (docket, CFR, redline) rather than true operational specificity, misaligning evaluation with real-world implementability.\n  - Scope mismatch: treating any detailed request as actionable even when it requires funding, interagency coordination, or statutory change outside the agency's authority.\n  - Overemphasis on formal legal markers: penalizing valid citizen asks that propose practical, program-level changes without formal citations.\n  - Inflexible granularity: applying the same specificity standard to short public comments and to long policy memos, producing unfair comparisons.\n  - Neglect of feasibility constraints: scoring high on 'specificity' without assessing whether the agency has the personnel, budget, or statutory authority to execute the plan.\n  - Single-axis tunnel vision: ignoring other relevant evaluation axes (e.g., equity, evidence quality, legal risk), causing escalation of technically specific but harmful or legally invalid requests.\n  - Misinterpretation of delegated asks: failing to detect when the citizen directs action to another entity (state, private sector), and thus mis-scoring agency-relevance.\n  - Temporal mismatch: rewarding immediate-execution specificity when the agency's appropriate response is long-term rulemaking or research, not immediate operational changes.\n- **Failure Cases:** \n  - False positive: a comment includes detailed-sounding redlines and office names but proposes actions that violate statute or require Congressional appropriation, yet receives a top score.\n  - False negative: a succinct, plain-language submission that names a feasible procedural change (e.g., alter intake workflow) lacks citations and is scored low despite being immediately implementable.\n  - Inconsistent calibration: near-duplicate comments with minor wording differences get different scores because the model latches onto differing surface tokens.\n  - Gaming: submitters deliberately inject legalistic boilerplate (fake docket numbers, mock citations) to get higher escalation scores which the model cannot reliably verify.\n  - Jurisdiction error: the model assigns responsibility to the wrong office/unit (e.g., regional enforcement vs. rulemaking staff) leading to improper escalation routing.\n  - Context miss: the model fails to recognize that a requested metric or timeline is unrealistic given known rulemaking timelines and scores it as actionable.\n  - Ambiguity failure: when a comment contains multiple asks with mixed levels of specificity, the model either averages out and obscures the actionable element or incorrectly focuses on the least actionable part.\n  - Adversarial phrasing: politically charged or rhetorical language masks concrete asks that the model dismisses as opinion, missing otherwise actionable items.\n  - Evidence-check failure: the model accepts citations or data claims at face value and rates an ask higher despite the underlying evidence being irrelevant or fabricated.\n  - Cross-axis conflict: the model escalates a highly specific but legally risky proposal because it optimizes for this axis alone, ignoring legal risk that would disqualify escalation.\n\n## Related Metrics\n\n- **Related Metrics:**\n  - **LevenshteinDistance:** Levenshtein Distance measures the minimum number of single-character edits\u2014insertions, deletions, or substitutions\u2014required to transform one sequence into another.\n  - **BARTScore:** BARTScore is a reference-based evaluation metric for text generation that formulates evaluation as a text generation task.\n  - **PseudoPARENT:** **PseudoPARENT** is a *custom adaptation* of the PARENT metric for evaluating text generation from structured inputs.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- **Papers:**\n  -

or an author with strong, directly relevant credentials (e.g., PhD, executive role) writing on behalf of the organization.<br/>\u2022 Provides quantitative or specific representation claims (e.g., number of members, jurisdictions served) and shows direct affectedness (e.g., regulated entities, frontline communities).<br/>\u2022 Good transparency: letterhead, full contact info, docket citations, signatory roles.<br/>\u2022 May include multiple co-signers or endorsements, though coalition breadth is limited (e.g., a few allied orgs).<br/>\u2022 Clear mission and domain alignment to the issue. |\n| 5 | Score 5 (Very high credibility AND broad/affected representation with coalition strength):<br/>\u2022 Major national or multi-regional organization(s) or coalition letter with numerous and/or diverse signatories (industry, municipalities, NGOs, labor, community-based orgs) clearly listed.<br/>\u2022 Explicit, substantial constituency reach (e.g., thousands of members, majority of sector coverage, large populations served) or uniquely high affectedness (e.g., utilities under the rule, heavily burdened communities) documented in the submission.<br/>\u2022 Author signatories hold senior roles and/or possess strong domain expertise (e.g., executives, technical directors, PhDs), writing in their official capacities.<br/>\u2022 Full transparency (official letterhead, contacts, docket references) and strong domain relevance.<br/>\u2022 May reference prior formal engagements (testimony, advisory panels) or provide organization-generated data, indicating established policy participation. |\n\n### Inputs and Outputs\n- **Inputs:**\n  - **Task description** *d*\n  - **Rubric** `**Source Credibility and Representation** Author expertise, organizational standing, coalition support, and whether the comment represents large or affected constituencies.`\n  - **Input text** *x*\n  - **Output text** *y*\n- **Outputs:**\n  - Scalar score $\\hat{s} \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n\n## Intended Use\n\n- **Domain:** Policy feedback evaluation / Text classification\n- **Tasks:** \n  - Triage of public comments for escalation to agency officials\n  - Credibility scoring of policy feedback submissions\n  - Identifying and enumerating signatories and coalition breadth in letters\n  - Flagging potential astroturfing or mass-produced comments\n  - Prioritizing high-impact stakeholder inputs for reviewer attention\n  - Generating short rationales tied to rubric criteria for each score\n  - Filtering submissions that require human verification or follow-up\n- **Best Suited For:** \n  - Submissions primarily in English and in standard textual formats (letters, comments, emails) where identity, affiliation, and signatory information are present or omitted explicitly.\n  - Large volumes of comments requiring consistent, repeatable triage according to a transparent rubric.\n  - Situations where the goal is to prioritize which submissions merit human escalation rather than to conclusively verify external claims.\n  - When comments include structured cues (letterhead, contact blocks, explicit membership counts, docket citations, lists of co-signers) that are directly mappable to the scoring guidelines.\n  - Contexts that benefit from quick, explainable justifications for scores (e.g., to create human-review queues or summary dashboards).\n- **Not Recommended For:** \n  - Cases that require external verification of claims (membership numbers, official roles, prior testimony) or authoritative fact-checking \u2014 the model cannot reliably confirm off-document facts.\n  - Submissions that are multimedia-heavy (scanned images of letters, audio/video testimony) without accurate OCR/transcription, or texts in languages the model is weak in.\n  - High-stakes legal or policy decisions where incorrect credibility assessments could cause material harm and thus require domain-expert adjudication.\n  - Highly adversarial or purposely deceptive inputs designed to spoof organizational credentials or fabricate coalitions without corroborating evidence.\n  - Narrow, highly technical domains with uncommon institutional codewords or localized organizational structures the model may not recognize without additional context.\n\n## Metric Implementation\n\n### Reference Implementations\n\n- **Libraries/Packages:**\n  - [AutoMetrics LLM as a Judge (reference-free)](https://github.com/XenonMolecule/autometrics/blob/main/autometrics/metrics/generated/GeneratedLLMJudgeMetric.py)\n\n### Computational Complexity\n\n- **Efficiency:**\n  - Requires a single LLM call per input-output pair.\n  - AutoMetrics does parallel calls on batched inputs.\n\n- **Scalability:**\n  - Performance is linear in the number of input-output pairs.\n  - Performance depends on the underlying LLM model and the dataset size.  Additional consideration would include whether or not the LLM is a reasoning model.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Biases:** \n  - Credentialism bias: privileging formal academic/professional credentials over lived experience or community knowledge.\n  - Institutional/status bias: favoring large, well-known organizations and letterhead, disadvantaging small grassroots groups.\n  - Format/visual bias: treating presence of letterhead, full contact info, or formal formatting as proxies for credibility.\n  - Language and cultural bias: penalizing submissions from non-native English speakers or different rhetorical styles.\n  - Name-recognition bias: giving extra weight to familiar institution names or senior-sounding titles.\n  - Coalition-size bias: equating larger signatory lists with substantive representation without verifying diversity or authenticity.\n  - Anonymity-averse bias: automatically lowering scores for anonymous submissions even when anonymity protects vulnerable individuals.\n  - Surface-evidence bias: overrelying on explicit numeric claims (member counts, jurisdictions) that may be unverified or inflated.\n  - Confirmation bias: interpreting ambiguous claims in a way that aligns with prior model exposure to similar documents.\n  - Recency/training-data bias: preferring organizational types and presentation styles common in the model's training set.\n- **Task Misalignment Risks:** \n  - Undervaluing affected individuals: the axis can systematically deprioritize individual but highly affected stakeholders who lack formal affiliation or credentials.\n  - Overvaluing self-interested groups: well-resourced industry or advocacy organizations may be scored high despite narrow or biased interests.\n  - Penalizing protected/vulnerable voices: anonymity or withheld contact info may reflect safety needs, not low credibility, leading to harmful exclusion.\n  - Misreading coalition breadth: counting signatories as representation without assessing whether signers reflect diverse or relevant constituencies.\n  - Conflating form with substance: the rubric may prioritize presentation quality (letterhead, citations) over factual accuracy or on-the-ground relevance.\n  - Domain mismatch: a single rubric may fail to account for domain-specific credibility signals (e.g., patents in tech vs lived experience in community health).\n  - False sense of verification: assigning high credibility based on claims the LLM cannot externally verify (membership numbers, prior testimony).\n  - Disincentivizing grassroots testimony: public procedures may favor institutional commenters, skewing agency attention away from frontline impacts.\n  - Ambiguity in multi-author submissions: the rubric may not specify how to score mixed-author inputs (expert co-signers plus anonymous community members).\n  - Overemphasis on coalition breadth could ignore depth of impact (a small but uniquely affected group may be more relevant than a large but peripheral coalition).\n- **Failure Cases:** \n  - Classifying an anonymous whistleblower's detailed, verifiable technical account as 'Very Low' because contact info is absent, thereby failing to escalate a critical issue.\n  - Elevating a polished coalition letter with fabricated signatories and inflated membership counts to 'Very High' because of formatting and large numbers.\n  - Downgrading grassroots submissions written in non-standard English or with culturally distinct rhetorical styles, missing important affectedness evidence.\n  - Failing to detect astroturfing when a lobby group submits many coordinated comments with slight variations, instead scoring them as broad grassroots representation.\n  - Scoring a small local nonprofit low because it lacks letterhead or formal membership numbers, despite the organization being the primary affected party.\n  - Treating long, data-heavy industry comments with unverifiable proprietary claims as high credibility while ignoring conflicts of interest.\n  - Missing domain nuance: giving a high score to an author with a PhD in an adjacent field whose expertise does not apply to the docket's technical area.\n  - Misinterpreting co-signer lists: counting numerous minor endorsements as evidence of broad representation when signers are duplicate or irrelevant entities.\n  - Penalizing a victim/survivor who omits contact info for privacy, thereby silencing a directly affected constituency in the escalation pipeline.\n  - Failing to flag obviously fake organizations with realistic-sounding names because the model overrelies on lexical heuristics rather than verification.\n\n## Related Metrics\n\n- **Related Metrics:**\n  -

- **Tasks:** 
  - Rank candidate drafts by strength of evidentiary support for escalation decisions
  - Detect vague, missing, or fabricated citations and flag traceability issues
  - Assess whether quantitative claims are sourced and whether magnitudes/timeframes are provided
  - Extract cited sources (titles, years, docket IDs, URLs) and summarize their relevance
  - Classify submissions into rubric categories (1–5) and provide brief rationale
  - Suggest concrete citation improvements or additional evidence needed for escalation
- **Best Suited For:** 
  - Large volumes of text-based policy feedback where fast, consistent triage is needed (e.g., initial pass to prioritize staff review).
  - Drafts that include explicit citation text (titles, authors, docket IDs, URLs) so the model can evaluate specificity and traceability.
  - Scenarios where the goal is to apply a fixed rubric across many items rather than perform final legal/technical adjudication.
  - Environments where the model’s output will be combined with human review or automated link-checking for verification.
  - When submissions make quantitative claims that can be judged for presence/absence of sources and unit/magnitude clarity.
  - Situations that benefit from consistent, descriptive feedback to contributors on how to improve evidence and citations.
- **Not Recommended For:** 
  - Needs real-time verification of external links, paywalled or subscription-only documents, or live data lookups that the model cannot perform.
  - Final agency decision-making or legal admissibility determinations that require authoritative primary-source validation.
  - Highly technical scientific or engineering claims that require reanalysis of primary datasets or replication of methods.
  - When submissions rely on unpublished/confidential documents or proprietary databases the model cannot access or verify.
  - Languages, formats, or domain-specific citation conventions the model has not been trained on or that are highly specialized.
  - Situations where hallucination risk is unacceptable and every citation must be independently confirmed without human oversight.</pre></div></li>

- **Tasks:** 
  - Triage public comments and citizen submissions for escalation to agency officials
  - Score and label drafts for clarity, organization, and civility against the provided rubric
  - Extract and validate presence/format of procedural identifiers (docket IDs, rule titles) from text
  - Detect and flag missing or incomplete contact information and produce a follow-up checklist
  - Assess attachments for accessibility when text-based content or searchable OCR is included
  - Generate short summary or executive-notes highlighting deficiencies that block agency action
  - Pre-screen submissions for potential procedural red flags (hostile tone, ambiguous docket references, inaccessible exhibits)
- **Best Suited For:** 
  - Input documents are provided as machine-readable text or searchable OCR (not image-only scans).
  - The rubric and expected docket ID formats are well-specified or follow consistent patterns the model can learn to recognize.
  - The goal is rapid triage and prioritization rather than final legal judgment.
  - Attachments are included inline or as clearly labeled text excerpts, enabling accessibility checks without external link fetching.
  - Human reviewers are available to act on items the model flags as high-priority or ambiguous.
- **Not Recommended For:** 
  - Attachments or evidence are only available via external links that the model cannot fetch or verify (broken links or remote files).
  - Submissions are image-only scans without OCR or have low-quality scans that impede text extraction.
  - Tasks require authoritative verification of docket numbers, filing status, or other facts that need access to agency databases or the internet.
  - High-stakes legal interpretation, official determinations, identity/authenticity verification, or decisions with regulatory liability are required without human oversight.
  - Multilingual inputs or domain-specific jargon without provided glossaries that might lead to tone and intent misclassification.</pre></div></li>
<li><strong>Specificity_of_Ask_and_Actionability_Rubric:</strong><div class="mt-2"><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; background:#f8f9fa; padding:8px; border-radius:6px;">- **Domain:** Policy evaluation / Regulatory comment triage / Text classification
- **Tasks:** 
  - Triage and prioritization of public comments for agency escalation
  - Automated scoring of policy feedback drafts against a rubric (specificity/actionability)
  - Highlighting and extracting explicit asks, timelines, and responsible offices from submissions
  - Generating summary rationales for escalation decisions to assist human reviewers
  - Batch processing and ranking of candidate responses for docket-focused review
- **Best Suited For:** 
  - High-volume review contexts where consistent, rubric-based scoring is required to surface the most actionable submissions for human attention.
  - Submissions in English with reasonably clear prose and standard regulatory vocabulary (docket IDs, section references, statutory citations).
  - When the agency can provide the model with contextual metadata (docket number, relevant rule text, examples of scored comments) to calibrate judgments.
  - Triage workflows that require highlighting exact language supporting a score (e.g., explicit wording of asks, named offices, timelines) rather than final legal determinations.
  - Scenarios where the goal is to prioritize or summarize items for legal/policy staff who will conduct deeper review and decide on escalation.
- **Not Recommended For:** 
  - Cases that require definitive legal interpretation of statutes, delegation-of-authority questions, or binding legal advice without human legal review.
  - Highly technical scientific or engineering feasibility assessments that require domain specialists and empirical validation.
  - Comments in languages other than those the model was trained/tuned on, or submissions with heavy use of nonstandard abbreviations or poor OCR quality.
  - Situations with extremely low tolerance for hallucination (e.g., automatic redlining or issuing directives) where outputs would be acted on without human oversight.
  - Environments lacking representative training examples or contextual docket/rule information, which increases risks of inconsistent or inaccurate scoring.</pre></div></li>

- **Tasks:** 
  - Triage of public comments for escalation to agency officials
  - Credibility scoring of policy feedback submissions
  - Identifying and enumerating signatories and coalition breadth in letters
  - Flagging potential astroturfing or mass-produced comments
  - Prioritizing high-impact stakeholder inputs for reviewer attention
  - Generating short rationales tied to rubric criteria for each score
  - Filtering submissions that require human verification or follow-up
- **Best Suited For:** 
  - Submissions primarily in English and in standard textual formats (letters, comments, emails) where identity, affiliation, and signatory information are present or omitted explicitly.
  - Large volumes of comments requiring consistent, repeatable triage according to a transparent rubric.
  - Situations where the goal is to prioritize which submissions merit human escalation rather than to conclusively verify external claims.
  - When comments include structured cues (letterhead, contact blocks, explicit membership counts, docket citations, lists of co-signers) that are directly mappable to the scoring guidelines.
  - Contexts that benefit from quick, explainable justifications for scores (e.g., to create human-review queues or summary dashboards).
- **Not Recommended For:** 
  - Cases that require external verification of claims (membership numbers, official roles, prior testimony) or authoritative fact-checking — the model cannot reliably confirm off-document facts.
  - Submissions that are multimedia-heavy (scanned images of letters, audio/video testimony) without accurate OCR/transcription, or texts in languages the model is weak in.
  - High-stakes legal or policy decisions where incorrect credibility assessments could cause material harm and thus require domain-expert adjudication.
  - Highly adversarial or purposely deceptive inputs designed to spoof organizational credentials or fabricate coalitions without corroborating evidence.
  - Narrow, highly technical domains with uncommon institutional codewords or localized organizational structures the model may not recognize without additional context.</pre></div></li></ul></div></div>

  - Authority bias: favoring government/academic sources and downgrading community, industry, or non‑traditional evidence regardless of relevance.
  - Recency bias: giving more weight to newer sources even when older foundational studies or legal citations are more relevant.
  - Format bias: preferring fully formatted citations and URLs over informal but accurate references or attachments.
  - Language and geographic bias: privileging English‑language or U.S. federal sources and undervaluing non‑English or local/regional evidence.
  - Quantitative bias: favoring submissions that present numbers even when qualitative evidence is more informative for the issue.
  - Traceability bias: equating the presence of a URL or docket ID with credibility without verifying content.
  - Publication bias: overvaluing peer‑reviewed literature and undervaluing credible gray literature (technical reports, agency memos).
  - Confirmation bias: tending to credit evidence that aligns with common assumptions about policy impacts more readily than surprising counterevidence.
  - Availability bias: relying on sources the model has been trained on or can recall easily, disadvantaging obscure but valid sources.
  - Conservatism bias: penalizing novel analyses or original calculations because they lack an established publication trail.
- **Task Misalignment Risks:** 
  - Scoring may prioritize traceable citation form over decision relevance, favoring citations that are easily verifiable rather than those most directly informing agency action.
  - The rubric can encourage citation padding—adding many superficial or low‑quality references to get a higher score—rather than substantive evidence integration.
  - It may penalize concise but high‑quality submissions that summarize evidence without reproducing full citations or links.
  - The judge might undervalue first‑hand community testimony or qualitative harms that are highly relevant for policy but lack traditional citations.
  - Because the model cannot access paywalled or proprietary attachments, it may downgrade otherwise strong, decision‑relevant evidence that isn't public.
  - The rubric assumes public, reproducible citations; submissions based on internal agency data or confidential sources could be misjudged.
  - Local or context‑specific evidence (e.g., tribal, municipal data) may be unfairly scored lower for not matching national‑level citation norms.
  - The axis focuses on evidentiary depth and may miss timeliness or urgency signals that warrant escalation despite limited citations.
- **Failure Cases:** 
  - Hallucinated verification: the model asserts that quoted citations are valid or finds supporting text when it cannot actually access the source.
  - False negatives for shorthand citations: downgrading submissions that use accepted shorthand (e.g., 'EPA Toxics 2020') even though a human reviewer would recognize them.
  - False positives for fabricated citations: awarding higher scores to convincing but nonexistent reports or doctored docket IDs because format looks plausible.
  - Inability to follow links or attachments: incorrectly scoring a submission as low‑evidence because links are to paywalled PDFs or attachments the model cannot retrieve.
  - Overrating quantity over quality: giving high scores to submissions listing many low‑credibility links (blogs, press releases) instead of a few strong sources.
  - Misinterpreting statistical claims: failing to spot misuse of statistics (e.g., incorrect denominators, conflating percentage points with percent change) and overrating evidence quality.
  - Failure to detect cherry‑picking: not recognizing when numbers are selectively presented without acknowledging counterevidence or uncertainty.
  - Inconsistency across similar inputs: scoring similar submissions differently due to subtle wording changes that trigger different internal heuristics.
  - Context blindness: treating a legal citation as authoritative even when jurisdiction or statutory context makes it irrelevant to the agency's authority.
  - Adversarial formatting: being manipulated by maliciously formatted text (fake URLs, embedded citations in images) to inflate a submission's score.
  - Over‑penalizing qualitative evidence: incorrectly assigning the lowest scores to persuasive firsthand accounts because they lack traditional citations.
  - Undervaluing original analysis: penalizing submissions that include novel calculations because the judge cannot reproduce methods or validate datasets.</pre></div></li>
<li><strong>Clarity_Structure_and_Procedural_Completeness_Rubric:</strong><div class="mt-2"><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; background:#f8f9fa; padding:8px; border-radius:6px;">- **Biases:** 
  - Formality bias: preferring professional, well-formatted language and downranking grassroots or informal but actionable submissions.
  - Surface-cue bias: overweighting explicit metadata (docket numbers, headers) over implicit or paraphrased procedural references.
  - Native-language bias: misjudging clarity or civility for non-native or dialectal phrasing as less readable or less civil.
  - Civility detection errors: failing to detect sarcasm, coded hostility, or polite but hostile framing and thus mis-scoring tone.
  - Attachment accessibility bias: penalizing attachments that are accessible to humans but not machine-readable (e.g., scanned PDFs without OCR).
  - Conservatism/leniency calibration bias: systematic tendency to score more harshly or leniently depending on training examples or default thresholds.
  - Template familiarity bias: rewarding submissions that follow common templates and penalizing novel but valid organizational formats.
  - Confirmation/anchoring bias: initial cues (e.g., a clear docket ID) anchoring the score and causing the model to overlook other deficiencies.
- **Task Misalignment Risks:** 
  - Over-prioritizing formatting over substance, causing highly substantive but informally presented comments to be under-escalated.
  - Penalizing legitimate privacy-conscious submissions that intentionally omit full contact details, thereby missing actionable policy signals.
  - Treating presence of a docket ID as sufficient for escalation even when the substantive content references the wrong proceeding or misunderstanding.
  - Equating machine-readable attachments with real-world accessibility and ignoring context where a human reviewer could readily access materials.
  - Reducing complex procedural nuance (e.g., comments intended for different agency office or multiple dockets) to a single score, losing important distinctions for escalation.
  - Favoring submissions that match bureaucratic expectations and marginalizing nontraditional stakeholders (community groups, oral testimony transcripts).
  - Applying rigid civility standards that could suppress escalation of urgent but emotionally charged citizen feedback.
  - Failing to account for redacted or anonymized submissions that are nevertheless delegable to officials for policy significance.
- **Failure Cases:** 
  - False negative: a clearly actionable submission is scored low because it uses informal structure and lacks a formal header.
  - False positive: a well-formatted template letter with incorrect docket ID is scored highly and escalated despite pointing to the wrong rule.
  - OCR/attachment failure: attachments are present as scanned images and are treatable as inaccessible, causing downgrading despite being readable to human reviewers.
  - Link resolution failure: the model marks hyperlinks as broken because it cannot follow or validate them, even though they work in a browser.
  - Civility misclassification: polite but critical language is flagged as hostile due to sarcasm or idiomatic expressions, lowering the civility score.
  - Contact detection error: the model misses contact information that is present but embedded in a signature image or unconventional location.
  - Docket parsing error: transposed digits or slight formatting differences cause the model to treat a correct docket reference as absent/incorrect.
  - Inconsistent scoring: nearly identical submissions receive different scores across runs due to nondeterministic model outputs or subtle prompt sensitivity.
  - Over-reliance on explicit headings: submissions with clear logical flow but without explicit headings are underrated relative to wordier submissions with headings.
  - Accessibility overreach: the model downgrades submissions for not including alt text or accessibility metadata even when the agency does not require it, causing unnecessary non-escalation.
  - Privacy-preserving submission missed: anonymous or redacted submissions with high policy relevance are rejected because contact details are missing.
  - Hallucinated content: the model asserts the presence of attachments or contact details that do not exist, creating incorrect recommendations for escalation.</pre></div></li>
<li><strong>Specificity_of_Ask_and_Actionability_Rubric:</strong><div class="mt-2"><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; background:#f8f9fa; padding:8px; border-radius:6px;">- **Biases:** 
  - Surface-form bias: overvaluing explicit citations, docket numbers, or legalistic phrasing even when underlying requests are impractical.
  - Recency and training-data bias: relying on patterns in training corpora that may not reflect current statutes, agency structures, or recent rulemaking practices.
  - Formality bias: favoring submissions that use technical or formal language and penalizing plain-language citizen input regardless of substance.
  - Jurisdictional bias: assuming common agency responsibilities or structures and misattributing which office/unit can act.
  - Conservatism bias: penalizing novel or unconventional but feasible implementation ideas because they deviate from familiar templates.
  - Confirmation bias from keywords: interpreting presence of certain words (e.g., 'CFR', 'docket', 'redline') as proxies for high actionability.
  - Language and cultural bias: lower scoring for submissions that use different rhetorical styles, idioms, or non-native-English phrasing.
  - Overconfidence bias: producing confident judgments about legal or operational feasibility despite lacking authoritative verification.
- **Task Misalignment Risks:** 
  - Keyword overfitting: optimizing for presence of axis-specific words (docket, CFR, redline) rather than true operational specificity, misaligning evaluation with real-world implementability.
  - Scope mismatch: treating any detailed request as actionable even when it requires funding, interagency coordination, or statutory change outside the agency's authority.
  - Overemphasis on formal legal markers: penalizing valid citizen asks that propose practical, program-level changes without formal citations.
  - Inflexible granularity: applying the same specificity standard to short public comments and to long policy memos, producing unfair comparisons.
  - Neglect of feasibility constraints: scoring high on 'specificity' without assessing whether the agency has the personnel, budget, or statutory authority to execute the plan.
  - Single-axis tunnel vision: ignoring other relevant evaluation axes (e.g., equity, evidence quality, legal risk), causing escalation of technically specific but harmful or legally invalid requests.
  - Misinterpretation of delegated asks: failing to detect when the citizen directs action to another entity (state, private sector), and thus mis-scoring agency-relevance.
  - Temporal mismatch: rewarding immediate-execution specificity when the agency's appropriate response is long-term rulemaking or research, not immediate operational changes.
- **Failure Cases:** 
  - False positive: a comment includes detailed-sounding redlines and office names but proposes actions that violate statute or require Congressional appropriation, yet receives a top score.
  - False negative: a succinct, plain-language submission that names a feasible procedural change (e.g., alter intake workflow) lacks citations and is scored low despite being immediately implementable.
  - Inconsistent calibration: near-duplicate comments with minor wording differences get different scores because the model latches onto differing surface tokens.
  - Gaming: submitters deliberately inject legalistic boilerplate (fake docket numbers, mock citations) to get higher escalation scores which the model cannot reliably verify.
  - Jurisdiction error: the model assigns responsibility to the wrong office/unit (e.g., regional enforcement vs. rulemaking staff) leading to improper escalation routing.
  - Context miss: the model fails to recognize that a requested metric or timeline is unrealistic given known rulemaking timelines and scores it as actionable.
  - Ambiguity failure: when a comment contains multiple asks with mixed levels of specificity, the model either averages out and obscures the actionable element or incorrectly focuses on the least actionable part.
  - Adversarial phrasing: politically charged or rhetorical language masks concrete asks that the model dismisses as opinion, missing otherwise actionable items.
  - Evidence-check failure: the model accepts citations or data claims at face value and rates an ask higher despite the underlying evidence being irrelevant or fabricated.
  - Cross-axis conflict: the model escalates a highly specific but legally risky proposal because it optimizes for this axis alone, ignoring legal risk that would disqualify escalation.</pre></div></li>
<li><strong>Source_Credibility_and_Representation_Rubric:</strong><div class="mt-2"><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; background:#f8f9fa; padding:8px; border-radius:6px;">- **Biases:** 
  - Credentialism bias: privileging formal academic/professional credentials over lived experience or community knowledge.
  - Institutional/status bias: favoring large, well-known organizations and letterhead, disadvantaging small grassroots groups.
  - Format/visual bias: treating presence of letterhead, full contact info, or formal formatting as proxies for credibility.
  - Language and cultural bias: penalizing submissions from non-native English speakers or different rhetorical styles.
  - Name-recognition bias: giving extra weight to familiar institution names or senior-sounding titles.
  - Coalition-size bias: equating larger signatory lists with substantive representation without verifying diversity or authenticity.
  - Anonymity-averse bias: automatically lowering scores for anonymous submissions even when anonymity protects vulnerable individuals.
  - Surface-evidence bias: overrelying on explicit numeric claims (member counts, jurisdictions) that may be unverified or inflated.
  - Confirmation bias: interpreting ambiguous claims in a way that aligns with prior model exposure to similar documents.
  - Recency/training-data bias: preferring organizational types and presentation styles common in the model's training set.
- **Task Misalignment Risks:** 
  - Undervaluing affected individuals: the axis can systematically deprioritize individual but highly affected stakeholders who lack formal affiliation or credentials.
  - Overvaluing self-interested groups: well-resourced industry or advocacy organizations may be scored high despite narrow or biased interests.
  - Penalizing protected/vulnerable voices: anonymity or withheld contact info may reflect safety needs, not low credibility, leading to harmful exclusion.
  - Misreading coalition breadth: counting signatories as representation without assessing whether signers reflect diverse or relevant constituencies.
  - Conflating form with substance: the rubric may prioritize presentation quality (letterhead, citations) over factual accuracy or on-the-ground relevance.
  - Domain mismatch: a single rubric may fail to account for domain-specific credibility signals (e.g., patents in tech vs lived experience in community health).
  - False sense of verification: assigning high credibility based on claims the LLM cannot externally verify (membership numbers, prior testimony).
  - Disincentivizing grassroots testimony: public procedures may favor institutional commenters, skewing agency attention away from frontline impacts.
  - Ambiguity in multi-author submissions: the rubric may not specify how to score mixed-author inputs (expert co-signers plus anonymous community members).
  - Overemphasis on coalition breadth could ignore depth of impact (a small but uniquely affected group may be more relevant than a large but peripheral coalition).
- **Failure Cases:** 
  - Classifying an anonymous whistleblower's detailed, verifiable technical account as 'Very Low' because contact info is absent, thereby failing to escalate a critical issue.
  - Elevating a polished coalition letter with fabricated signatories and inflated membership counts to 'Very High' because of formatting and large numbers.
  - Downgrading grassroots submissions written in non-standard English or with culturally distinct rhetorical styles, missing important affectedness evidence.
  - Failing to detect astroturfing when a lobby group submits many coordinated comments with slight variations, instead scoring them as broad grassroots representation.
  - Scoring a small local nonprofit low because it lacks letterhead or formal membership numbers, despite the organization being the primary affected party.
  - Treating long, data-heavy industry comments with unverifiable proprietary claims as high credibility while ignoring conflicts of interest.
  - Missing domain nuance: giving a high score to an author with a PhD in an adjacent field whose expertise does not apply to the docket's technical area.
  - Misinterpreting co-signer lists: counting numerous minor endorsements as evidence of broad representation when signers are duplicate or irrelevant entities.
  - Penalizing a victim/survivor who omits contact info for privacy, thereby silencing a directly affected constituency in the escalation pipeline.
  - Failing to flag obviously fake organizations with realistic-sounding names because the model overrelies on lexical heuristics rather than verification.</pre></div></li></ul></div></div>

      <h3>Metric Summary</h3>
      <p>This aggregate metric estimates how escalation-worthy a policy feedback draft is by linearly combining four rubric scores, with the greatest weight on evidentiary support and the next on clarity/procedural completeness. In practice, submissions that clearly cite sources, quantify claims, and are well-structured will be ranked higher, while precise asks/actionability contribute only marginal gains and source credibility currently has negligible effect. The intended use is fast, explainable triage: sort large volumes of comments, surface the top-scoring items for human review, and provide a consistent first-pass signal. Strengths include transparency (coefficients show which qualities matter), ease of maintenance, and alignment with review workflows that value traceable evidence and readable formats. Key limitations are the low sensitivity to actionability and the effective disregard for stakeholder credibility/representation, which can suppress escalation of highly feasible, constituency-significant input. Because the component rubrics carry known biases (e.g., favoring formal citations and large institutions), the aggregate score may systematically disadvantage grassroots or qualitative evidence unless counterbalanced. Treat the score as a ranking heuristic, not a probability; calibrate thresholds on a validation set and monitor precision/recall tradeoffs to meet capacity and equity goals. Refit and recalibrate periodically to avoid overfitting to historical patterns, and consider adding constraints or regularization if coefficient drift diminishes actionability or fairness. Pair automated ranking with targeted human checks for legal authority, verification of citations, and context on stakeholder representation.</p>

      <strong>Sensitivity</strong> (worse_obvious): how much the metric tends to drop when the output is intentionally degraded. For each example, we measure the relative drop from the original to the average worse_obvious score, clip negative values to 0 (no drop), and then average across examples.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Stability</strong> (same_obvious): how consistent the metric stays under neutral edits that should not change meaning. For each example, we measure how close the original is to the average same_obvious score (scaled by the original magnitude), clip below 0, and then average across examples. Higher means more stable.
